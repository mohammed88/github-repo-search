### Project code organization:

Elements - Basic UI elements such as Link, Dropdown. Go to `src/ui`.

Components - are a combination of UI elements to create functional UI modules of the app. Go to `src/components`.

Views - are pages within the app and are built up of one or more Components. Go to `src/views`.

### Technology stack:

React, Styled Components, React Router.

### Storybook:

Project's UI components are built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Run `yarn storybook` to view the storybook components.

### E2E tests:

End-to-end tests are executed with [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). Run `yarn e2e`. Sreenshots are available under `tests/e2e/__screenshots__`

### Unit tests:

Unit tests are executed with Jest framework. Run `yarn test`.

All Tests: 34 passed, 34 total
Snapshots: 13 passed, 13 total

### Development mode:

For development mode run `yarn start`.

### Folder/Files naming convention:

Stand alone module folders and files are named with PascalCase. Otherwise, kebab-case is used.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
